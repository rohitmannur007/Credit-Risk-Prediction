📊 Credit Risk Prediction (German Credit Data)

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates credit risk prediction using the German Credit dataset. The goal is to classify applicants as good or bad credit risk based on demographic and financial information.

The work is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (credit card.ipynb), showcasing the full ML workflow: data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

⸻

🗂 Dataset
	•	File: german_credit_data.csv
	•	Size: 1,000 records, 21 features
	•	Target Variable:
	•	Good (1): Low credit risk
	•	Bad (0): High credit risk

⸻

⚙️ Workflow
	1.	Data Preprocessing
	•	Handle missing values
	•	Encode categorical variables
	•	Normalize numerical features
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Distribution plots
	•	Feature correlations
	•	Risk trends by demographics & credit attributes
	3.	Modeling
	•	Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
	•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
	4.	Evaluation Metrics
	•	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
	•	ROC-AUC curve

⸻

📈 Results
	•	Best performance achieved with Random Forest / XGBoost
	•	Key predictive features: Credit Amount, Duration, Age, Savings, Employment
	•	Achieved ROC-AUC > X.XX (see notebook for details)

👉 This version makes it crystal clear that your project lives in a Jupyter Notebook, so recruiters know they can view results directly without running a full backend.

Do you want me to extract the actual accuracy/F1/ROC-AUC values from your notebook and insert them in the README so it looks more professional?
